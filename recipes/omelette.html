    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The omelette is such a great dish beacuse it is healthy, 
        delicious, and customizable. You can put pretty much anything 
        you want in it, and by changing up your ingredients, you will 
        never get bored.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 or 3 eggs</li>
        <li>Cheese (I use American)</li>
        <li>Vegetables (onion, zuchinni, tomato (yes, I will include tomato here), etc.)</li>
        <li>Meats (bacon, turkey bacon, sausage, etc).</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, chop up and indredients you will use.</li>

        <li>Put some olive oil on a pan and put the heat to high.</li>

        <li>Put your vegetables or meats in, and cook them a decent amount.</li>

        <li>Then, crack and break your eggs into a bowl 
            and beat them until they homogenous.</li>

        <li>Lower the heat of the pan to low or low-medium and pour the eggs in.</li>

        <li>With your spatula, push the egg and tilt the pan to get the raw eggs to cook. 
            Keep doing this, and by doing this you will create layers.</li>

        <li>When there is a minimal amount of raw egg, raise the heat of the pan. 
            Move the omelette around the pan to make sure it can slide and flip it.</li>

        <li>Lower the heat again and put cheese on the omelette.</li>
        
        <li>Once the bottom has cooked, fold the omelette in half and, voila, 
            your omelette is ready to serve!</li>
    </ol>
